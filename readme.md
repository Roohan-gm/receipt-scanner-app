   cd receipt-scanner-app

   npm install
```

2.**Go to Google AI Studio**

 1. Visit Google AI Studio
 2. Create a new project and generate your API key
 3. Create a .env file in your project root:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

"Note: The application uses the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model for optimal performance and cost efficiency."

```

"Scan the QR code using Expo Go on your mobile device, or run on a simulator with npx expo start --ios or npx expo start --android."

## Limitations and Assumptions of the Receipt Scanner App

AI/ML Model Constraints

- Image Quality Requirements: Optimal performance requires clear, well-lit, non-blurry receipt images
- Format Compatibility: Best suited for standard retail receipts; may encounter challenges with:
  - Handwritten or non-standard receipt formats
  - Non-English language receipts
  - Highly dense or cluttered layouts
- Extraction Accuracy: Field recognition (vendor, total, date) may vary based on receipt formatting and quality

API and Infrastructure

- Connectivity Dependency: Requires active internet connection for AI processing
- Usage Quotas: Subject to Google Gemini free tier limits (60 requests/minute, 1,500 requests/day)
- Cost Considerations: Extended usage beyond free tier may incur charges

Platform Considerations

- Device Performance: Image processing performance may vary on older or lower-end devices
- Storage Capacity: Utilizes AsyncStorage with platform-specific storage limits (~6MB on Android)

Data Handling

- Date Formats: Supports standard date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD)
- Currency Agnostic: Extracts numeric values independent of currency symbols
- Category Classification: Predefined categories include Food & Drinks, Groceries, Transportation, Entertainment, Shopping, and Other

Security and Privacy

- Local Storage: All data remains on-device with no external transmission beyond AI processing
- Development Security: API key exposure in client code is acceptable for personal use but not recommended for production deployment

User Experience

- Manual Processing: Requires user-initiated image capture and processing
- Data Integrity: No duplicate detection or manual field correction capabilities
- Analytics Scope: Monthly expense tracking with basic visualization capabilities

This application is designed as a personal expense management tool and serves as an excellent foundation for more advanced financial tracking solutions.
